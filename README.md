# Diamond Square GUI

This repository contains a graphical user interface (GUI) implementation of the Diamond-Square algorithm. The Diamond-Square algorithm is a procedural generation technique used to create realistic terrain and landscapes. This implementation allows users to visualize and interact with the algorithm through a simple and intuitive GUI.

## Features

- **Generate Terrain**: Create terrains using the Diamond-Square algorithm.
- **Visualization**: View the generated terrain.
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Modify parameters such as roughness to change the appearance of the terrain.
- **Save Terrain**: Save the generated terrain to an image file.

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Feuerswut/diamond-square-gui.git
    cd diamond-square-gui
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Generating Terrain**:
    - Open the GUI by running the application.
    - Adjust the parameters such as the size of the terrain and roughness.
    - Click the "Generate" button to create the terrain.

2. **Viewing and Saving Terrain**:
    - View the generated terrain in the GUI.
    - Click the "Save" button to save the terrain as an image file.
